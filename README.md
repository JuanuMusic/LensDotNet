# LensDotNet
![LensDotNetLogo](assets/lensdotnetlogo.png?raw=true)

LensDotNet is a .NET library that provides an easy and efficient way to interact with the Lens API. This library enables you to seamlessly utilize Lens API in various platforms, such as desktop applications, mobile apps using ~~Xamarin~~ MAUI, and games using Unity.

## Supported Frameworks
- .net Standard 2.1
- .net 6.0
- .net 7.0

## Installation

To install LensDotNet, you can use NuGet Package Manager. You can either use the Package Manager Console or the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

### Package Manager Console

Run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Install-Package LensDotNet
```

### NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select 'Manage NuGet Packages...'
3. Search for 'LensDotNet' and install the package.

## Usage

### Basic Setup
Here's a very basic example of how to use LensDotNet:

```csharp
using LensDotNet;

// Create a LensClient instance
var config = new LensConfig("https://api-mumbai.lens.dev");
var client = new LensClient(config);

// Call ExploreProfiles and print results.
var profiles = await client.Explore.ExploreProfiles();
Console.WriteLine($"Found {profiles.Items.Length} profiles");
foreach (var profile in profiles.Items)
    Console.WriteLine($"name: {profile.Name} - owner: {profile.OwnedBy} - id: {profile.Id}");

```

### Authenticating
Most mutations (write calls) to the API, require that the user is authenticated.
Authentication is a set of steps that requires the user to sign a message with the wallet that owns the profile.
To do this, LensDotNet decouples the Signing process letting the implementator (you) chose the way to do it.

This is how it works:

```csharp
using LensDotNet;

// Create a LensClient instance
var config = new LensConfig("https://api-mumbai.lens.dev");
var client = new LensClient(config);

// Generate a challenge passing the user address
var challenge = await client.Authentication.GenerateChallenge(account.Address);

// Sign the challenge string with whatever method you want.
var signature = yourSignerImplementation.Sign(challenge.Text, account);

// Authenticate the client with the signed message and the address.
await client.Authentication.Authenticate(account.Address, signature);

// Check if user is authenticated
if(await client.Authentication.IsAuthenticated())
  Console.WriteLine("Authenticated!");
else
  Console.WriteLine("Not authenticated!");

```

Also, a guide for using with Unity is in progress. [Look Here](https://github.com/JuanuMusic/LensDotNet/tree/main/src/Examples/LensDotNet.Examples.Unity/README.md).
